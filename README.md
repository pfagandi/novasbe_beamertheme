These files represent a Beaber Themed for Nova School of Business and Economics.

Because the use of specific fonts to be in according to the School's graphic image
the project needs to be compiled with LuaLaTeX, it will not compile with pdflatex.

It might compile with XeLaTeX. Note that both LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX are installed
with TeXLive or MikTeX, or are available on Overleaf, so this should not represent
a problem. Sometimes you will have to have installed PERL if you are using your
personal computer.

To start, you can open "example.tex" and begin modifying with whatever you want
to have in your presentation.
